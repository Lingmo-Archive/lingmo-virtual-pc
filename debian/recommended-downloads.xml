  These are operating systems listed in the recommended section of the
  "Download an OS" page.

  This list is powered by libosinfo, therefore the IDs are unique identifiers
  for each OS in osinfo-db. Use "osinfo-query os" in the CLI to list all available
  operating systems and their respective IDs.

  Downstreams are encouraged to tweak the list as they wish. Sorting is also
  available.

  "title", "subtitle" and "url" can be overwritten by distributors.

  Distributors can host their own recommended-downloads.xml file, and point to it
  with the org.lingmo.boxes recommended-downloads-url gsetting.

  See https://gitlab.lingmo.org/Lingmo OS/lingmo-virtual-pc/-/wikis/recommended-downloads.xml
